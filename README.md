[Medium Link](https://medium.com/@pgburrack/bidirectional-communication-between-a-web-page-and-chrome-extension-e0ee1de6a294)

## Overview
This repo includes examples that demonstrated achieving two way communication between a web page (that I don't own) and a chrome extension.

## Examples

- [Example](examples/externally-connectable) for using `externally_connectable` and `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
- [Example](examples/mutation-observer) for using the Javascript `MutationObserver` API.
